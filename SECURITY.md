## Security Policy

### Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue for security-sensitive reports.

Instead, email the maintainer:

- `dev@ismarbegic.com` (preferred)

If that address is not monitored for your fork, open a GitHub issue with **no sensitive details** and ask for a private contact channel.

### Supported versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest released version and `main`.
